:description: I am a freelance photographer servicing clients all around Israel. My photojournalistic approach and years of experience working for TV news provides me with an effortless skill in photographing weddings and events. I document the most special moments of people’s lives, frame by frame with special attention to composition and light. At events I take the fly-on-the-wall approach in order to maintain a natural and unobtrusive environment for my clients. I’m currently displaying my personal work in various exhibits.
